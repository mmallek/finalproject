\textbf{Goals}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item
Write algorithm to run exhaustive model selection \\
\item
Compare models chosen by different selection criterion \\
\item
Check model diagnostics - Was the class of models explored appropriate? \\
\item
Discuss challenges of model selection \\
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Sara: Variable Selection and Model Diagnostics}

\textbf{Class of models considered in this analysis:} \\
\begin{itemize}
\item
All possible subsets of variables \\
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Criterion used:} \\
\begin{itemize}
\item
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) \\
\item
Bayes Information Criterion (BIC) \\
\item
Adjusted R squared \\
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile, allowframebreaks]{Sara: Variable Selection and Model Diagnostics}
\textbf{The algorithm} \\
There were 10 possible predictor variables considered in analysis of \emph{NCbirths}. To make it simpler, 4 variables are considered here.\\
\medskip
Creates a matrix where each $row_i$ corresponds to one possible combination of predictor variables \\
% Having trouble displaying output
<<echo=FALSE>>=

# the variable names we want to consider in the model
vars <- c("gained","premie","habit","whitemom")

# create combinations (one column = one possible combination)
one <- combn(vars,1)
two <- combn(vars,2)
three <- combn(vars,3)
four <- combn(vars,4)

ones <- cbind(t(one),0,0,0)
twos <- cbind(t(two),0,0)
threes <- cbind(t(three),0)
fours <- t(four)

combos <- rbind(ones,twos,threes,fours)

\begin{frame}[fragile, allowframebreaks]{Sara: Variable Selection and Model Diagnostics}

Iterate through the rows of the matrix and fit a linear model, with $weight$ as the response variable \\

\begin{frame}{Sara: Variable Selection and Model Diagnostics}

\textbf{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
\item
This method does not consider transformations of variables or interactions \\
\item
Model selection is subjective - which criterion is best? - how would you select a model? \\
\item
Differences between possible models are subtle \\
\item
In the actual analysis, wanted to be able to interpret betas, but models were stronger with transformations and interactions - difficult interpretation \\
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Residuals and Leverage}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Determine whether our model assumptions can be used before making an inference
\item  Look for violations and look for the consequential inferential procedures 
\item Combines both graphical and statistical methods. 
\item Leverage = ability to move a regression model by itself by moving in the y direction.  
\item Leverage is always between one and zero 
\item Zero means there is no effect on regression model

\textbf{Cooke's Distance}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Cook's Distance is a measure of the influence an observation has on a fitted line. 
\item The Cook's Distance of the ith observation can be calculated using the following formula:
\item $\frac{r_{i^2}}{p}$ X $\frac{H_{ii}}{1-H_{ii}}$
\item $r_i$ is the value of the {standardised residual} of the ith observation
\item p is the number of parameters and Hii is the ith diagonal term in the Hat Matrix

\begin{frame}{Maritza: Classification and Regression Trees}

\textbf{What are Trees?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Non parametric way to model a dataset. 
\item Classification trees for $y$ as a categorical response
\item Binary recursive partitioning used to subdivide dataset
\item 2 primary packages in R: tree and rpart
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Maritza: Classification and Regression Trees}

\textbf{Applying Classification Tree Method to this dataset}
\begin{itemize}
\item Used factored weight variable: split on 5.5 lbs (biologically relevant)
\item Initially used tree package
% move tree picture to here
\item Pruned with 10-fold cross-validation
\item Output dissatisfying
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\textbf{Prediction?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Seems obvious that weeks would predict low birth weight
\item What about variables not directly associated with pregnancy?
\item Is it fair to include predictors that are measured at the same time as the response?
\item Revised model:
\end{itemize}
<<model2, results='hide'>>=
lowbirthweight ~ fage + mage + marital + gender + habit + whitemom
@

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Maritza: Classification and Regression Trees}
\textbf{Results}
\begin{itemize}
\item Split once, on marital
\item Neither node contained a majority of ``low birth weight''
\item Next step is to adjust stopping criteria
\item All variables but gender used, but high deviance
\item Therefore we have a negative result for this dataset: anticipated predictors, such as marital status, smoking, age, and ethnicity, turned out not to be important - at least not detectable by the tree
\item Use trees with caution! Results indicate other data (not collected) may contain important predictors.
\end{itemize}
